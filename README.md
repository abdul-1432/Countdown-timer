# Countdown Timer

This repository provides a simple countdown timer implementation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The countdown timer is a useful feature to display and track time remaining for events, deadlines, or any time-sensitive information.


## Features

- Easy integration into your web projects.
- Configurable countdown duration and format.
- Styling customization options.
- Lightweight and optimized for performance.
- Compatible with modern browsers.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To use the countdown timer in your project, follow these steps:

1. Download the repository as a ZIP file or clone it using the following command:

   ```bash
  (https://github.com/abdul-1432/Countdown-timer)
   ```

2. Copy the necessary files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) to your project directory.

### Usage

To add the countdown timer to your website, follow these steps:

1. Include the required CSS and JavaScript files in the `<head>` section of your HTML file:

   ```HTML
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/countdown-timer.css">
   <script src="path/to/countdown-timer.js"></script>
   ```

2. Create a container element for the countdown timer:

   ```HTML
   <div id="countdown-timer"></div>
   ```

3. Customize the styling and format of the countdown timer by modifying the CSS file or adding your own styles.

4. Initialize the countdown timer by calling the `start countdown()` function with the desired countdown duration and format:

   ```javascript
   <script>
     document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {
       start the countdown('2023-12-31T23:59:59', 'DD:HH:MM: SS');
     });
   </script>
   ```

   In the example above, the countdown timer is set to count down to December 31, 2023, 23:59:59, and the format is specified as "DD:HH:MM: SS" (days, hours, minutes, seconds).
